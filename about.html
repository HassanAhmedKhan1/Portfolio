            I am currently pursuing a B.Tech at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), with a strong interest in software development and programming. I have gained proficiency in Python and full stack web development, enabling me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. Additionally, I am actively learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ to strengthen my problem-solving skills. I am passionate about applying my knowledge to real-world projects and continuously expanding my technical expertise in the field of computer science.
